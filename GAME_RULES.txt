## Gameplay

### Turn Structure
The game proceeds in alternating turns between Player 1 and Player 2.

#### Each Turn Consists Of:
1. **Draw Phase**: Draw the top card from the deck
2. **Decision Phase**: Choose to keep or discard the drawn card
   - **Keep**: Replace one of your two cards with the drawn card (discarded card goes to graveyard)
   - **Discard**: Discard the drawn card to graveyard and keep both original cards
3. **Special Power Phase**: If you discarded a special card (10, J, Q, K), you may use its power
4. **Show Phase**: Decide whether to call "Show" to end the game

## Special Card Powers

When you **discard** a special card (10, J, Q, or K), you have the option to activate its special ability:

### 10 (Ten) - Self Peek 👁️
- **Effect**: Look at one of your own two cards
- **Strategy**: Helps you know what you have before making swap decisions

### J (Jack) - Opponent Peek 🔍
- **Effect**: Look at one of your opponent's two cards
- **Strategy**: Gain information about opponent's hand for strategic decisions

### Q (Queen) - Blind Swap 🔄 (RIGHT NOW NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- **Effect**: Swap one of your cards with one of your opponent's cards **without looking**
- **Strategy**: Risky move that can benefit you if you suspect opponent has low cards

### K (King) - Informed Swap 👑 (RIGHT NOW NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- **Effect**: Look at both cards (one of yours and one of opponent's), then decide whether to swap
- **Strategy**: Most powerful card - see before you swap, but limited availability

> **Note**: In the current implementation, Queen and King powers are disabled (commented out in code)

---

## Ending the Game

### "Show" Declaration
At the end of each turn, the active player can declare **"Show"** to end the game.

#### Show Rules:
- **If Player 1 declares Show first**:
  - Player 2 does NOT get a final turn
  - Game ends immediately

- **If Player 2 declares Show first**:
  - Player 1 gets ONE final turn
  - Game then ends

### Automatic End
- If the draw pile is depleted (no cards left), the game ends in a **tie**

---

## Winning Conditions

### Point Calculation
At the end of the game:
1. All cards are revealed
2. Each player's two cards are totaled using the points system
3. The player with the **LOWER total** wins

### Winner Determination
- **Player with fewer points**: WINS 🏆
- **Equal points**: TIE 🤝
- **Deck depleted**: TIE 🤝

## Strategy Tips

### General Strategy
- **Low cards are valuable**: Aces (1 point) and low numbers are your best cards
- **Red Kings are golden**: K♥ and K♦ worth 0 points - extremely valuable!
- **Jokers help**: -1 point means they reduce your total
- **High cards are dangerous**: Face cards (especially black Kings at 13 points) hurt your score

### Information Management
- Remember which card you looked at initially
- Use 10s and Jacks to gain information before making swaps
- Track what cards have been discarded to infer what's left

### Timing Your Show
- Call "Show" when you believe you have lower points than your opponent
- Be cautious - if Player 2, remember Player 1 gets a final turn
- Don't wait too long - opponent might improve their hand

### Special Power Usage
- **10s**: Use early to know your hand better
- **Jacks**: Use to scout opponent before attempting swaps
- **Queens**: High risk/reward - only use if desperate or confident
- **Kings**: Best power - use wisely for optimal swaps

- 67: 10's power - which own card to see
- 68: Jack's power - which opponent card to see
- 69-71: Queen/King related (currently disabled)
